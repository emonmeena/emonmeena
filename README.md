Brief me - I am back home, after wearing sketchy part of a freshman's life at IIT Roorkee. 
During my stay, I learned much about many things, both technical and others as well. 
Yaa, I miss the place so much, especially my friends🧡.
Apart from development, I do [CP](https://www.codechef.com/users/maksai00), [blogging](https://medium.com/@mayank16meena) and contribute to [open-source](https://github.com/mayank-genesis/). <br>
